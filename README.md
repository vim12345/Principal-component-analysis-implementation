# Principal-component-analysis-implementation

# Description:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that reduces the dimensionality of data while preserving as much variance as possible. It helps with visualization, noise reduction, and improving performance of other algorithms. In this project, weâ€™ll use PCA to reduce the Iris dataset from 4D to 2D for visualization.

# What PCA does:

* Identifies the directions (principal components) of maximum variance

* Projects data into lower dimensions with minimal information loss

* Helps in visualization and preprocessing for machine learning
